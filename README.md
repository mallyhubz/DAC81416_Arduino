# DAC81416_Arduino
A basic BETA library for TI's DAC81416 precision DAC and the associated DAC81416EVM

**See `main.cpp` for an working example. Compile with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.**

**Platforms:**
I tested the code with arduino Uno. The code should work for other platforms as well. 
Please report if something is not working.

**Limitations:**
1. BETA versions - some bugs may exist. Please report if you encounter something. 
2. LDAC pin is not handled by the library.

**TODO:**
1. Code cleanup
2. Toggles
3. More examples
